## dotfiles

@ekampf's dotfiles
Your dotfiles are how you personalize your system. These are mine.


## Install

Clone the repo (Or fork it...):

    git clone git://github.com/ekampf/dotfiles.git

Install required gems:

    gem install bundler && bundle install

Run the bootstrap script:

    bundle exec ruby bootstrap.rb

#### Personalize

I keep all my project files at ~/Documents/workspace. You probably don't...
So the first thing to do in order to get things working is to override the $WORKSPACE environment variable:

    echo "export WORKSPACE=\"... whatever path you use ...\"" > ~/.zshenv.local

You can put other customizations in dotfiles appended with `.local`:

* `~/.aliases.local`
* `~/.gitconfig.local`
* `~/.tmux.conf.local`
* `~/.vimrc.local`
* `~/.zshenv.local`
* `~/.zshrc.local`

For example, your `~/.aliases.local` might look like this:

    # Productivity
    alias todo='$EDITOR ~/.todo'

    # Easy Folder access
    alias go='cd $HOME/Documents/workspace'

And so on...


#### Whats in it?

<TODO>

tmux configuration:

* Improve color resolution.
* Remove administrative debris (session name, hostname, time) in status bar.
* Set prefix to `Ctrl+s`
* Soften status bar color from harsh green to light gray.
